## My process
My process was to building this profile strictly using only HTML and CSS. No css grid or flexbox just straight HTML an CSS. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS and HTML only

### What I learned

That CSS has come a long way since I first stared in web design. There are so many new and old selectors, properties and values that I haven't really explored and these challenges and FrontEnd Mentor have really inspired me to dig deeper. It never hurts to review the basics. This challenged I played around and practice with the transition property. It's almost liking animating an element without actually animating an element using less code.

### Continued development

One more challenged to go in the beginner level (well that are free). FrontEnd Mentor you are going to have me paying for a subscription soon.

### Useful resources
Tools I use constantly when working with CSS
- [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) - This site provides up-to-date browser support tables for support of front-end web technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers.
- [Validate your CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - Validate your CSS use W3C's css validator. Great tool for learning and checking your code.
